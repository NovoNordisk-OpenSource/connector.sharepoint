The connector.sharepoint package provides a convenient interface for accessing and interacting with Microsoft SharePoint sites directly from R. This vignette will guide you through the process of connecting to a SharePoint site, retrieving data, and performing various operations using this package.

This package is meant to be used with [connector]("https://github.com/NN-OpenSource/connector") package, which 
provides a common interface for interacting with various data sources. The connector.sharepoint package extends the connector package to support Microsoft 
SharePoint sites.

## Installation

You can install the connector.sharepoint package using the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("connector.sharepoint")

# Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("NN-OpenSource/connector.sharepoint")
```


## Usage

Package is meant to be used alongside connector package, but it can be used 
independently as well. Here is an example of how to connect to a SharePoint site
and retrieve data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(connector.sharepoint)

# Connect to SharePoint
con <- connector_sharepoint(site_url = "sharepoint_url")
```

When connecting to SharePoint, you need to provide the URL of the SharePoint 
site. By default, token is retrieved from the [AzureAuth]("https://github.com/Azure/AzureAuth") package using `get_token()` 
function, or it can be provided by the user, and it is used to authenticate the 
user to the SharePoint site.

Example of how to use the connector object:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# List content
con |> 
  list_content_cnt()

# Write a file
con |> 
  write_cnt(iris, "iris.rds")

# Read a file
con |> 
  read_cnt("iris.rds") |> 
  head()

# Remove a file
con |> 
  remove_cnt("file_name.csv")
```

## Usage with connector package

Here is an example how it can be used with connector package and configuration 
YAML file (for more information take a look at the connector package):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Connect using configuration file
yaml <- yaml::read_yaml(system.file("config", "example_yaml.yaml", package = "connector.sharepoint"), eval.expr=TRUE)

connector <- connector::connect(yaml)

# List content
connector$test |> 
  list_content_cnt()

# Get SharePoint connection object
connector$test |> 
  get_conn()

# Write a file
connector$test |> 
  write_cnt(iris, "Test/iris.csv")

# Read a file
connector$test |> 
  read_cnt("Test/iris.csv")

```
